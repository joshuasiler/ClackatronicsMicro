Yes, it's possible to combine your MicroPython runtime and your program into a single UF2 file for deployment on a Raspberry Pi Pico. This approach is particularly useful for production environments or when you want to streamline the deployment process. Here's how you can achieve this:

Set Up Your Development Environment on Ubuntu:

Install Necessary Tools:

Ensure you have the required build tools installed on your system. On a Raspberry Pi OS, you can install them using:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake build-essential libffi-dev git pkg-config gcc-arm-none-eabi

Clone the MicroPython Repository:

Navigate to your working directory and clone the MicroPython repository:

git clone https://github.com/micropython/micropython.git
cd micropython
git submodule update --init -- lib/pico-sdk lib/tinyusb

Prepare Your Program for Freezing:

Create a Directory for Your Scripts:

Inside the ports/rp2 directory, create a folder named modules if it doesn't already exist:

cd ports/rp2
mkdir -p modules

Add Your Scripts:

Place your .py files into the modules directory. These scripts will be frozen into the firmware.

Build the Custom MicroPython Firmware:

Compile the mpy-cross Compiler:

Navigate back to the MicroPython root directory and build the mpy-cross compiler:

cd ../../mpy-cross
make

Build the Firmware with Frozen Modules:

Return to the ports/rp2 directory and build the firmware:

cd ../ports/rp2
make clean
make BOARD=RPI_PICO submodules
make

This process will generate a firmware.uf2 file in the build-RPI-PICO directory, which includes both the MicroPython runtime and your frozen scripts.

Deploy the Combined Firmware to the Pico:

Enter Bootloader Mode:

Press and hold the BOOTSEL button on your Raspberry Pi Pico.

While holding the button, connect the Pico to your computer via USB.

Release the BOOTSEL button once the Pico appears as a mass storage device named RPI-RP2.

Copy the UF2 File:

Drag and drop the firmware.uf2 file onto the RPI-RP2 drive. The Pico will reboot automatically, running the new firmware with your embedded program.

By following these steps, you create a single UF2 file that includes both the MicroPython runtime and your program, simplifying the deployment process. This method is particularly advantageous for deploying to multiple devices or for production programming.
